"""
Greedy Algorithm for the Dwarf Bridge Crossing Problem.

This program uses a greedy algorithm to find the minimum time for all the dwarfs to cross the bridge.
A greedy algorithm i dangerous, just because it is greedy. It takes the best option that is right in front
of the eyes of the algorithm at any moment. It doesn't look at the whole picture. This means that it is risky to use,
and that it is not generic. It only works for a specific problem under specific conditions. However, it is usually
easy to implement a greedy algorithm to a problem. Just remember it can go horribly wrong and that it may be
difficult to prove if a greedy algorithm is ok to use for a specific problem.

Nevertheless, I believe (without proving it) that a greedy algorithm can be used to find the solution of
the dwarf problem, as it is originally stated.

The problem:
There are 300 dwarfs that need to cross a bridge in the middle of the crispy cold polar night.
It is a rickety bridge in poor condition which only holds for at most two dwarfs to cross at a time.
It is pitch dark and they only have one lantern, which they need in order to cross the bridge.
If two dwarfs crosses the bridge together someone has to bring the lantern back for the others to be able to cross.
However, no dwarf wants to cross the bridge more than 3 times (i.e. over, back and over again).
Each dwarf requires different amount of time to cross the bridge: 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, â€¦, up to 300 min
for the slowest dwarf. When two dwarfs walk together, they walk in the slowest pace.
What is the fastest time they can cross the bridge for all 300 to be on the other side, and how will they achieve this?


Solution Strategy:
1. Minimize the average of the difference in speed when two dwarfs walk together over the bridge.
2. Minimize the average of the time it take for the dwarfs that need to walk back with the lantern.

The reason for number 1 is that we want to waste as little as possible of a faster dwarf's speed. The speed is given
by the time it takes for a dwarf to cross the bridge. Since all the dwarfs required different amount of time to
cross the bridge the difference in time between two dwarfs will always be at least 1 minute, meaning that the
faster dwarf will have to walk 1 minute slower that what he could. He is loosing one minute. We want to minimize
that loss over all the dwarfs that are crossing. Since it will always be at least 1 minute difference between any
two dwarfs, the average cannot be less that 1 minute. We will aim for an average of 1 minute. If we reach this we
know that we have minimized the time it took for the dwarfs to cross the bridge, which is half the problem, and
which is the reason for number 1 above.

The other half of the problem is that we want to minimize the time it takes for the dwarfs to walk back with the
lantern. This can be done by always making sure that the fastest dwarf that still has crossings left will be on
the other side of the bridge ready to walk back with the lantern.


Implementation:
Note: Even though this problem is well structured and clearly defined I will create a generic implementation where
      the number of the dwarfs can vary, their time to cross can be changed, the maximum crossings can be changed,
      and the maximum number of dwarfs that can cross the bridge together can be changed.
      The two reasons for this are:
      a) The structure and the logic in the code becomes more clear when things are defined in one place instead
         of hardcoded all over the program. The logic also becomes more obvious when the code explicitly shows
         the decisions made.
      b) It is possible to test the algorithm with other conditions very easily and do other experiments.
         However, pay attention to that this is a greedy algorithm, which a risky way to solve a problem and
         also very likely to fail outside of its domain. A domain that is difficult to know exactly.

1. All dwarfs will be sorted after their speed, i.e. after how much time they need to cross the bridge.
2. To start, the two fastest dwarfs will cross the bridge in order to have the fastest dwarf available to
   walk back with the lantern.
3. The fastest of the dwarfs that crossed will walk back with the lantern.
4. Check where the fastest dwarf with at least enough crossings left is located.
   If dwarf is before the bridge (at start), at least 3 crossings left are required. Otherwise the dwarf can't
   go back with the lantern, so the speed is of no benefit.
   If the dwarf is after the bridge (at finish), at least 2 crossings left are required for the same reason.
   4a) If that is before the bridge and we don't waste a faster dwarf to come back with the lantern,
       send that dwarf over together with the second fastest dwarf available
   4b) If that is after the bridge, find the two dwarfs with the least difference in speed. If there are several,
       send the two fastest.
5. Send the fastest dwarf with enough (which is 2) crossings left back with the lantern.
6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until there are no more dwarfs available to cross.
7. Keep track of the crossing times:
   7a) When dwarfs cross together we are aiming for an average of the difference in speed of 1 minute
   7b) For the returning dwarfs we are aiming for an average of (1 + number of returns) / 2.
   7c) Note that these numbers are only valid when the problem is structured as described above, with
       the fastest dwarf crossing the bridge in 1 minute, and when it is always a difference of 1 minute in speed
       between dwarfs next to each other when ordered after their speed, and that the maximum number of
       crossings are 3 for all the dwarfs.
8. Print the result:
   8a) Print the time it took for all the dwarfs to cross.
   8b) Print the scheme showing how the dwarfs crossed the bridge back and forth.
   8c) Print if this is an optimal result as aimed for in point 7 above.
